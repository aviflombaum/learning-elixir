# Welcome to Learning Elixir

I'm Avi Flombaum and you're here to watch me learn elixir as part of [Flatiron School's](https://flatironschool.com) #BackToCode Challenge.

## Schedule (all times are EST)

- Sept 8th: 4pm - 8pm
- Sept 15th: 4pm - 8pm
- Sept 23rd: 12pm - 4pm
- Sept 29th: 4pm - 8pm

## Goals

1. Build a procedural CLI Tic Tac Toe

2. Build a OO? CLI Tic Tac Toe
  - Refactoring the CLI TTT to not have to pass around board constantly.
  - better knowledge of the player...
  - potentially an 1 player vs computer?
  - tests
  - use mix, better structure (more elixir like)
  - IEx.pry is in a loop (recursion, how to continue, and not abort)

  - What else can we build to get exposure to Elixir in CLI before moving onto a web-based thing?
  - Maybe a scraper / CLI?
  
3. Build a Phoenix, web-baesd, no DB, Tic Tac Toe

4. Build a Phoenix, web-based, DB, Tic Tac Toe

## Where I'm At

1. I've read [Programming Elixir](https://pragprog.com/book/elixir/programming-elixir) 2-3 times without writing a line of Elixir.

2. I've read [Intro to Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html) 2-3 times without writing a line of Elixir.

3. I've read [Intro to Phoenix](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/overview.html) 1-2 times without writing a line of Elixir or trying a Phoenix application.

4. I've read some project source code to see what's what.

5. I program in Ruby, Javascript, and more for like 20 years.
